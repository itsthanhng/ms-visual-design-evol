            <h1>The Raise of Mobile Devices</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">iPhone made it first entrance in 2007, opening a new era of smart mobile devices that work like “a computer in your pocket”. Since then it has radically changed our habits and expectation of technology: we shifted from surfing the Internet on desktops to browsing websites on mobile devices. The design workflow, thus, needed to evolve to meet the needs of users.</p>

                        <h3>Desktop-Only</h3>
                        <p>Back in the days when smartphones were still not that popular, web development focused solely on desktop and bigger screen, therefore, the web browsing experience on mobile was not that pleasing: One needed to always zoom-in because the text was too small to read, the layout got out of hand from being scaled down vigorously, and some functionalities didn’t really work on mobile.</p>

                        <p>The desktop-first approach, which has been practiced since the beginning of the Smartphones, starts with the development on highest specifications first, then scales down to lower resolutions (graceful degradation). Two main approaches in this field are Responsive and Adaptive.</p>

                        <h3>Mobile-First Design</h3>
                        <p>This is an approach that prioritize the interaction on mobile devices, then aims for higher resolutions (progressive enhancement). Browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand JavaScript or media queries, so a recommended practice is to create a basic website and enhance it for smart phones and PC, rather than rely on graceful degradation to make a complex, image-heavy site work on mobile phones.</p>

            <h1>Human-Centered Design</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Human-Centered Design is an approach to problem solving, commonly used in design and management frameworks that develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process. Human involvement typically takes place in observing the problem within context, brainstorming, conceptualizing, developing, and implementing the solution.</p>

            <p>To have a clearer insight of what modern visual design is, let’s take a look how Microsoft Windows’ User Interface evolved through 25 years, from 1995 to 2020, and see how you come to your own definition of modern visual design.</p>
